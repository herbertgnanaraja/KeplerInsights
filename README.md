## Project Overview:
The scientific objective of the Kepler Mission is to explore the structure and diversity of planetary systems, using a special-purpose spacecraft to measure light variations from thousands of distant stars, looking for planetary transits.

Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) are well vetted, periodic, transit-like events in the Kepler data. The Kepler Project identifies these objects from the Threshold-Crossing Events (TCE) list for further vetting. Some objects will be flagged as false positives.
